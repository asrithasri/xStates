### XStates
As a developer i will build XStates, a basic frontend implementation by using ReactJS for the frontend.

### Objective
The project aims to create an interactive location selection component that dynamically populates country, state, and city dropdown menus based on API data and display it accordingly.

# Upon initial render, 3 dropdowns (Select Country, Select State, Select City) must appear out of which only the first one must be allowing the users to view the dropdown list
# When you click on Select Country, you must get a dropdown menu of country names
# When you select a particular country (e.g. Australia), you must be able to further select state using the Select State dropdown, but you must not be able to use the Select City dropdown yet.
# Once you click on Select State, you must get a dropdown of list of states present in the selected country. For example, in our case, we must only be able to see the states that are a part of Australia
# Once you select a particular state, you must be able to choose a city using the Select City dropdown.
# Once you click on Select City, you must get a dropdown of list of cities present in the selected state. For example, in our case, we must only be able to see the cities that are a part of Western Australia
# Once you select a particular city, you must get a statement on the frontend in the following format:
"You Selected City, State, Country":


-------------
Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
